# terminal-doom

DOOM inside your terminal

![terminal-doom](media/terminal-doom.gif)

### Install (macOS & Linux):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenfield-inc/terminal-doom/main/install.sh | bash
```

The game comes with it, wad included.

### Usage

```
Usage: terminal-doom [options]

  terminal-doom                 Play DOOM in this terminal pane
  terminal-doom --split right   Play in a new pane beside what you are doing

Options:
  --split <direction>   Open in a new pane: right, left, down, up
  --size <fraction>     How much space a new split takes (0.2 to 0.95)
  --port <n>            Serve the game on a fixed port
  --serve               Only start the server and print its url
  --windowed            Keep the browser toolbar, for debugging
  --version             Print the version
  -h, --help            Print this help
```

You need a terminal that speaks the kitty graphics protocol: ghostty, kitty,
WezTerm, cmux, or the terminal inside VS Code. On macOS, `brew install --cask
ghostty`.

Fullscreen the terminal before you play. The game is 320x200 upscaled to
whatever the pane is, so a bigger pane is a bigger, sharper DOOM.

### Controls

![Controls: W A S D to move, arrow keys or mouse to turn, Ctrl to fire, and Space for doors and switches](docs/assets/terminal-doom-controls.png)

| Action | Key |
| --- | --- |
| Move | `W` `A` `S` `D` |
| Turn | arrow keys, or the mouse |
| Fire | `ctrl` |
| Open doors and switches | `space` |
| Weapons | `1` to `7` |
| Menu | `esc` |
| Quit the pane | `ctrl+q` |

Leave it alone at the title screen and DOOM plays the attract demos id shipped
in the wad in 1993.

Two things to know before you get attached to a run. Sound effects work; music
is off because the port's OPL emulation hangs under emscripten. And the game's
filesystem lives in memory, saves included, so a run lasts exactly as long as
its session.

What ships is the shareware episode, Knee-Deep in the Dead. If you own the full
game, drop your own iwad in as `web/doom1.wad`.

### How this was made

Two agents made this, each doing the job it is good at. I run my work inside
[Pane](https://github.com/greenfield-inc/Pane), a workspace that gives every task its
own git worktree and agent terminal. A chat orchestrator sits above the agents,
a Claude Fable 5 session running the pane-orchestrator skill from
[greenfield-inc/skills](https://github.com/greenfield-inc/skills) with the workflow
conventions from [greenfield-inc/orchestra](https://github.com/greenfield-inc/orchestra). It
writes the briefs, dispatches the work, and carries my messages to agents while
they run.

I sent the orchestrator the
[terminal-code](https://github.com/zenbu-labs/terminal-code) tweet and asked
for DOOM the same way. This is the raw message, typos and all:

```
i saw a tweet go viral where someone got vs code running in a terminal (since
its just web/opens ource) and im wondering if we can do the same thing but get
doom running in a terminal using
https://github.com/zenbu-labs/terminal-browser#how-does-it-work (which is what
he used) i mainly wnat it to go viral lol
```

It created a worktree, wrote a one-page brief, and
handed it to a Claude Opus 5 agent. The brief set the ground rules: read
terminal-browser and terminal-code first, pick an existing web DOOM, ship the
shareware wad only, self-host everything so the install one-liner keeps working
on its own, prove that keys reach the game, and finish with a recording and the
steps to reproduce it. Everything else was the agent's to figure out: which
port, how to build it, what broke and why, and how to license a project whose
engine is GPL and whose data is shareware. It figured those out and reported
back. First command to public repo took 53 minutes, and the recording took
about another hour after I asked for polish.

The brief is in [BRIEF.md](BRIEF.md), verbatim, along with the one message the
orchestrator relayed mid-build. If you want to see what the delegation actually
looked like, that file is the whole of it.

My favourite part: the machine it worked on has screen recording switched off,
which left the agent blind to the terminal it was driving. So it wrote a
terminal. `scripts/capture.py` holds the far end of a pty, answers the queries
a real terminal answers, decodes the frames terminal-browser transmits, and
types back in the kitty keyboard encoding, held keys and modifiers included,
because a game needs key releases: a walk is a held key, a tap is a single step.

That one file ended up doing three jobs. It was the debugger, since every "is
this working" question became a png. It was the test suite, because a frame with
DOOM in it means the wasm booted, chromium rendered, the escape codes were well
formed and the keys arrived. And it was the camera: every frame in the recording
above is bytes terminal-browser actually wrote to a terminal, which is why the
ammo counter really does tick down as `ctrl` is pressed.

It found the boot bug the same way. DOOM was dying with a sprite error that
reads exactly like a corrupt wad, so it went and fetched the canonical shareware
wad, hash-verified it, watched the error survive, and then found the real cause
in a patch it had written itself twenty minutes earlier. That is the `_Bool`
story below.

### How does it work?

terminal-doom combines [terminal-browser](https://github.com/zenbu-labs/terminal-browser)
(a browser in the terminal) and [doom-wasm](https://github.com/cloudflare/doom-wasm)
(Chocolate Doom compiled to WebAssembly). A small server on loopback hands the
game to the browser, because wasm loads over http only.

So the frames go DOOM, wasm, chromium, escape codes, your terminal, 35 times a
second. Your keys make the same trip back. It works over ssh for the same reason
terminal-browser does: the frames are only bytes on the wire.

Three things the port needed before it would boot:

- `boolean` has to stay four bytes wide. `doomtype.h` declares its own
  `enum { false, true }`, which stopped compiling once SDL2 started including
  `<stdbool.h>`. Its fallback, `typedef bool boolean`, is quietly fatal: DOOM
  memsets sprite tables to `-1` and tests them against `true`, a comparison
  that holds for a four byte enum and breaks for a one byte `_Bool`. Read through a `_Bool` the
  sentinel comes back true, and the boot dies in `r_things.c` complaining about a
  sprite, which looks exactly like a corrupt wad.
- `-nomusic`, for the reason above.
- `force_software_renderer`, so the game draws through canvas 2d, whose pixels
  terminal-browser can read back.

`scripts/build-wasm.sh` rebuilds the engine from a pinned commit with a pinned
emscripten and applies those patches. The repo ships the result, ready to play.

### Testing it without a screen

`scripts/capture.py`, from the story above, is a normal way to test this thing:

```bash
scripts/capture.py --out media --video demo.mp4 --seconds 16 \
  --key 4.5:enter --hold 9.4:2.1:w --key 11.6:ctrl -- bin/terminal-doom
```

### Windows

The kitty graphics protocol is thin on the ground on Windows, so the build
targets macOS and Linux. Installing the Linux version inside
[WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) works.

### Licence

Three parts, three licences, spelled out in [NOTICE](NOTICE). The wrapper is
MIT. The engine is GPLv2, from Chocolate Doom. The wad is id Software shareware,
included unmodified. DOOM is a trademark of id Software LLC; this project is
independent of them.
